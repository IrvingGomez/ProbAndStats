# User Guide  
## Thotsakan Statistics

Welcome to the user documentation for **Thotsakan Statistics**, part of the **Himmapan Lab** ecosystem.

This guide is intended for students and instructors who want to use the application for learning, teaching, and exploring statistical methods.

---

# What You Can Do with This Application

Thotsakan Statistics allows you to:

- Load and explore datasets
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Generate graphical analysis (histograms, ECDF, KDE, etc.)
- Construct confidence and prediction intervals
- Perform hypothesis testing
- Run linear regression models

The software is designed to connect statistical theory with practical experimentation.

---

# Getting Started

If this is your first time running the project locally, follow:

```
getting_started.md
```

That guide explains:

- How to create a virtual environment
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the application
- How to troubleshoot common errors

---

# Datasets

Practice datasets are located in:

```
datasets/practice/
```

These datasets are intended for experimentation and coursework.

You are encouraged to:

- Explore different statistical methods
- Compare estimators
- Analyze the impact of model assumptions
- Interpret results critically

---

# Theory Connection

Statistical theory supporting the methods implemented in this application can be found in:

```
docs/theory/ProbAndStatistics.pdf
```

The goal of this project is not only to compute results, but to understand the statistical reasoning behind them.

---

# For Advanced Users

If you are interested in modifying or extending the software, see:

```
docs/developers/architecture.md
docs/developers/adding_new_feature.md
```
