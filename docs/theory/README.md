# Theory Documentation  
## Thotsakan Statistics – Himmapan Lab

This folder contains theoretical material supporting the statistical methods implemented in the Thotsakan Statistics application.

The purpose of this section is to connect:

- Mathematical theory  
- Statistical reasoning  
- Computational implementation  

The goal of the project is not only to compute results, but to understand the principles behind them.

# How Theory Connects to the Application

Each major section of the application corresponds to theoretical foundations:

| Application Area        | Theoretical Foundation |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Descriptive Statistics | Moments, distribution summaries |
| Graphical Analysis     | Empirical distribution, density estimation |
| Confidence Intervals   | Sampling distributions, asymptotic theory |
| Prediction Intervals   | Model uncertainty and variance decomposition |
| Hypothesis Testing     | Test statistics and significance levels |
| Linear Regression      | Least squares and statistical inference |

Students are encouraged to:

- Review the relevant theory before using a method.
- Compare theoretical formulas with implementation in `core/`.
- Reflect on assumptions behind each estimator or test.

# Educational Philosophy

The Himmapan Lab ecosystem emphasizes:

- Mathematical understanding
- Transparent implementation
- Reproducible computation
- Critical interpretation of results

This project is structured so that students can:

1. Learn the theory.
2. Inspect the implementation.
3. Experiment with data.
4. Extend the methodology.

# Future Expansion

As the Himmapan Lab ecosystem grows (e.g., Differential Equations and other advanced topics), each project will include a similar theory section linking:

- Formal mathematical foundations
- Computational implementation
- Practical experimentation

---

Understanding theory strengthens computational practice.  
Computation without theory is mechanical; theory without computation is abstract.  
This project is designed to unify both.
