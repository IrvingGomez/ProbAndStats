# ProbAndStats_CMKL

This repository collects notebooks and notes for exploring probability and statistics.

## Repository structure

- `ProbAndStatistics.pdf` – compiled notes summarizing theory and examples.
- `00_Preprocessing.ipynb` – notebook that cleans and merges external data (`DataWhr2024.csv` and `UnM49.csv`).
- `GradioStatistics.ipynb` – notebook that provides interactive visualizations via the Gradio library.
- `.git/` – version control history.

## Suggested learning path

1. Read through `ProbAndStatistics.pdf` to familiarize yourself with the concepts discussed in the course.
2. Run `00_Preprocessing.ipynb` to generate the processed dataset (ensure you have the required CSV files).
3. Open `GradioStatistics.ipynb` to explore the data interactively with Gradio and matplotlib.
